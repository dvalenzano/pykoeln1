pykoeln1
========

pykoeln1.py: using as input a *ped file - one family at a time - generates a marker-by-marker co-occurrence matrix  
* TODO1: make it callable from bash, rather than from within python. All one has to do is:
$ python pykoeln1.py
and it asks "what file do you want to process?"

pykoeln1_head
========
Calls pykoeln1 from shell
* TODO: add a warning if the file is mispelled/ is not found

Today's exectution:
$ python pykoeln1_head.py
What is the ped file you want to analyze?
NfGn_allpg_ped3_processed.csv
